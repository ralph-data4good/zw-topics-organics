## üßπ If It Works in Incognito: Clear Your Cache

### **Method A: Clear Cache (Recommended)**

#### For Chrome/Edge:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select **"All time"** from the dropdown
3. **Check ONLY**: "Cached images and files"
4. **Uncheck everything else**
5. Click **"Clear data"**
6. **Close and reopen your browser completely**
7. Visit: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/

#### For Firefox:
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select **"Everything"** from the dropdown
3. **Check ONLY**: "Cache"
4. **Uncheck everything else**
5. Click **"Clear Now"**
6. **Close and reopen your browser completely**
7. Visit: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/

### **Method B: Hard Reload (Quick but may not always work)**

2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. Or press `Ctrl + F5`

**Note**: This doesn't always work. Method A is more reliable.

2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Click the **"Network"** tab

With DevTools open and "Disable cache" checked, your browser will fetch fresh files every time.

## ‚ùì Still Not Working? Try These:

### 1. Different Browser
Try opening the site in a completely different browser:
- If you're using Chrome, try Firefox
- If you're using Edge, try Chrome
- Any browser you haven't used to visit the site

### 2. Wait 5 More Minutes
Sometimes CDN propagation takes longer. Wait 5 minutes and try again.

### 3. Check You're Going to the Right URL

**Correct URL:**
```
https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/
```

**Check for these common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Missing the trailing slash: `/zw-topics-organics`
- ‚ùå Wrong subdomain: `ralph-data4good.github.com` (should be `.io`)
- ‚ùå Typo in repository name

### 4. Test the 404 Page Directly

Try visiting:
```
https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/404.html
```

**What you should see:**
- A **blank white page** = 404.html is being served ‚úÖ
- GitHub's 404 page = 404.html is NOT being served ‚ùå

If you see GitHub's 404 page, let me know immediately.

## üîç Diagnostic Test

### Run this test:

1. Go to: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/

3. Click **"Console"** tab
4. Look for any RED error messages
5. Click **"Network"** tab
6. Refresh the page

## üÜò If NOTHING Works

If you've tried ALL of the above and it still shows 404:

### Tell me:
1. Which browser are you using? (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
2. Does it work in Incognito mode? (Yes/No)
3. Have you tried a different browser? (Yes/No)
4. What do you see at: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/404.html
5. Screenshot of the Console tab in DevTools (F12 ‚Üí Console)

I'll help debug further!

## üí° Why This Happens

**Browser caching** is when your browser saves old files to load pages faster. When we deployed the 404 fix, your browser still has the old version in memory.

**The fix IS deployed** - you just need to tell your browser to get fresh files instead of using the cached (old) ones.

---

## üéØ TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

1. ‚úÖ Open Incognito: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
2. ‚úÖ Go to: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/
3. ‚úÖ If it works there, clear your regular browser cache
4. ‚úÖ Close and reopen browser
5. ‚úÖ Done!

---

**Your site IS deployed correctly.** This is just a caching issue. Be patient and try the methods above! üöÄ
