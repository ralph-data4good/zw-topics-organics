# 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide - 404 Error Fixed

## ✅ What We Fixed

The **404 error** you were experiencing was caused by GitHub Pages not supporting client-side routing for React applications.

### The Solution Applied:

1. ✅ **Added `public/404.html`** - Redirects all routes to index.html
2. ✅ **Updated `index.html`** - Added script to handle redirected routes
3. ✅ **Rebuilt and redeployed** - Changes pushed to GitHub

---

## ⏱️ Wait for Deployment

The fix has been pushed to GitHub. Now wait for:

1. **GitHub Actions to rebuild** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Check Actions tab**: https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-topics-organics/actions
3. **Wait for green checkmark** ✅
4. **Refresh your site**: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/

### Clear Your Browser Cache:
- **Chrome/Edge**: Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
- **Firefox**: Ctrl + F5 (Windows) or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
- **Safari**: Cmd + Option + R (Mac)

## 🧪 Test After Deployment

Once the deployment completes, test these URLs:

- ✅ Home: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/
- ✅ Map: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/map
- ✅ Resources: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/resources
- ✅ Calculator: https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/calculator

All should work now without 404 errors!

## 🔍 How It Works

### The Problem:
GitHub Pages serves static files. When you navigate to `/map`, it looks for a file called `map.html` which doesn't exist, causing a 404.

### The Solution:
1. **404.html** catches all "not found" requests
2. It converts the URL path to a query parameter
3. **index.html** receives the converted URL
4. React Router reads it and navigates to the correct route
5. Browser history is updated to show the original clean URL

This is a common pattern for React SPAs on GitHub Pages!

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

### 1. Check Deployment Status
```
Visit: https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-topics-organics/actions
Wait for green checkmark ✅
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
Hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R) or open in incognito/private mode

### 3. Wait Longer
GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes to propagate changes

### 4. Verify Files Are Built
Check that `dist/404.html` exists:
```powershell
Test-Path "dist/404.html"
```

Should return `True`

### 5. Check Browser Console
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any error messages
4. Check Network tab for 404s
