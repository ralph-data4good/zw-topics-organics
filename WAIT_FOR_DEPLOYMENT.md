# ⏰ Wait for Deployment - Step by Step

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT TRIGGERED!

A fresh build has just been pushed to GitHub. Follow these steps:

---

## 📍 STEP 1: Open GitHub Actions (RIGHT NOW)

**Click this link:**
```
https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-topics-organics/actions
```

---

## 📍 STEP 2: Watch the Workflow

You should see a new workflow at the top with:
- **Title**: "Trigger deployment: Force rebuild with 404.html"
- **Status**: One of these three:

### 🟡 Yellow Circle (In Progress)
- **Meaning**: Building your site
- **Action**: WAIT (don't refresh your main site yet)
- **Time**: Usually 2-3 minutes

### ✅ Green Checkmark (Success!)
- **Meaning**: Deployed successfully!
- **Action**: GO TO STEP 3 BELOW
- **Time**: Done!

### ❌ Red X (Failed)
- **Meaning**: Build failed
- **Action**: Let me know immediately
- **Fix**: I'll help debug

---

## 📍 STEP 3: Once You See Green Checkmark ✅

### Wait 2 More Minutes
After the green checkmark appears, wait **2 additional minutes** for the changes to propagate to GitHub Pages CDN.

### Then Do This:

1. **Clear your browser cache completely**:
   - **Windows**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + Delete`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **OR do a hard refresh**:
   - **Windows**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

3. **Visit your site**:
   ```
   https://ralph-data4good.github.io/zw-topics-organics/
   ```

4. **Test all pages**:
   - Click on Map
   - Click on Resources
   - Click on Calculator
   - All should work WITHOUT 404 errors! 🎉

---

## 📍 STEP 4: Verify It's Working

### You'll Know It's Fixed When:
- ✅ Home page loads
- ✅ Navigation works
- ✅ All pages load without 404
- ✅ You can refresh any page
- ✅ Direct URLs work

### If Still Showing 404:
1. Try **incognito/private mode**
2. Try a **different browser**
3. Wait **5 more minutes** (sometimes CDN is slow)
4. Check if Actions workflow completed successfully

---

## ⏱️ TIMELINE FROM NOW

- **Right now**: Workflow triggered
- **+30 seconds**: Build starts
- **+2 minutes**: Build completes
- **+3 minutes**: Deployed to GitHub Pages
- **+5 minutes**: Fully propagated (SAFE TO TEST)

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

1. ✅ Open: https://github.com/ralph-data4good/zw-topics-organics/actions
2. ✅ Watch for yellow circle → green checkmark

## 🆘 EMERGENCY: If It's Still Not Working After 10 Minutes

2. Screenshot your browser (show me the error)
3. Tell me what you see
4. I'll help debug further

## ✨ THIS WILL WORK!
